# Quick Start

## Prerequisites

**csx** (Chainsight command-line execution envirionment) depends on several tools. Therefore, developers must have these tools installed and available in advance.

- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install): To generate Canister code to be compiled into Module
- [dfx](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install): To interact with Internet Computer

You can confirm that it has been installed and is in the path by running the following in a terminal.

```bash
% rustc --version 
rustc 1.79.0 (129f3b996 2024-06-10)
% dfx --version
dfx 0.15.1
```

## Note

Before you can deploy on your local machine, you need to deploy [chainsight-management-canisters](https://github.com/horizonx-tech/chainsight-management-canisters) to your local dfx environment.

## Install CLI

You can choose between the following two methods of installation.

- Download the prebuild CLI binaries
- Build the CLI from source code

Once you have followed either of these steps to install, you can confirm the installation with the following command.

```bash
csx --version
# -> csx version: x.y.z
```

> **Warning**  
> Currently only macos and linux environments are supported.  
> This is a limitation of the dfx specification on which it depends.

### Download the prebuild CLI binaries

Install and path the binary file according to your terminal from the following

[Releases Â· horizonx-tech/chainsight-cli](https://github.com/horizonx-tech/chainsight-cli/releases)

### Build the CLI from source code

Clone this repository and run cargo build.

```bash
cd horizonx-tech/chainsight-cli && cargo build --release && cargo install --path .
```

## Quick Start for your project

A small modification to the Manifest, which is placed when the project is initially generated, is all that is required to create a deployable component.

Let's actually create a project/component with the project name 'initial_project'.  
The 'new' command can be used to create a project with a specified project name.

```bash
# Create Chainsight project
csx new initial_project
```

Then modify the manifest.
Specifically, modify the rpc_url key to match your project.

Once the manifest is corrected to the correct one, the 'build' command can be executed to generate the module and execution commands to run canister.

```bash
# Build project
csx build --path initial_project
```

If the build command succeeds, deploy with the 'deploy' command.  
Remember to have a dfx network in your local area when deploying locally.

```bash
# Deploy project
# NOTE: If you deploy in local, dfx network must be started (ex: 'dfx start')
dfx start
csx deploy
```

When 'deploy' is complete, the 'exec' command sends the actual initialization and start of periodic execution instructions to the component.

```bash
# Initialize Components / Start processing
csx exec --path initial_project
```

# Terminology

## Manifest

Use **Manifest** to actually tell Chainsight what the developer wants to customize.

Specifically, this is a YAML file, and the developer's intent can be reflected by having the values set according to the format specified on the Chainsight side.

Currently, the following types of Manifest are available.

- Component Manifest
- Project Manifest

## Component

A Canister that contains a Module specialized for the data processes managed within the Chainsight Platform.

Chainsight defines several types of canisters specialized for certain applications, allowing users to select the type that best suits their needs and to freely customize items within that type.

The following Components are currently available on the CLI.

- Snapshot Indexer
  - Select the following types depending on the location of the data you wish to collect
    - Snapshot Indexer EVM: For EVM-based Other chains
    - Snapshot Indexer ICP: Other canisters on Internet Computer
    - Snapshot Indexer HTTPS: Resources available on the general web
- Event Indexer
- Algorithm Indexer
- Algorithm Lens
- Relayer

> **Note**  
> See following for all supported Component Types and their purpose.  
> [Data Processing Components - Chainsight Network](https://docs.chainsight.network/chainsight-architecture/data-processing-components)

## Project

Manage one or more Components together.

For example, at least Snapshot Indexer and Relayer are required to take a snapshot of ERC20's totalSupply obtained from Ethereum and flow it to other Chains.

Most objectives require combining multiple Components, and Project is provided to make them easier to manage.

Project consists of the following folders.  
However, these are not usually necessary to be aware of.

```txt
(project root)
|- artifacts # Artifacts generated by 'build' process
|- components # Place Component Manifest
|- interfaces # Place dependent interfaces (abi etc.)
|- project.yaml # Project Manifest
.chainsight
```

---

These are the Internet Computer concepts needed to better understand Chainsight

## HTTPS outcalls

HTTPS outcalls in the Internet Computer refer to making HTTP requests from a canister (smart contract) running on the Internet Computer to external HTTPS endpoints. It allows canisters to interact with external services, such as APIs or web servers, over secure HTTPS connections.

HTTPS outcalls are subject to certain limitations and security considerations imposed by the Internet Computer platform. For example, canisters have a set of allowed domains and endpoints they can make requests to, and the response size and request duration may be limited. These restrictions are in place to ensure the security, scalability, and resource efficiency of the Internet Computer network.

For more information, please check here.

[HTTPS outcalls: technology overview | Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/integrations/https-outcalls/https-outcalls-how-it-works)

## Timer Task

Unlike other blockchains, the Internet Computer can automatically execute canister smart contracts after a specified delay or periodically.

For more information, please check here.

[Periodic tasks and timers | Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/backend/periodic-tasks)

# Commands

Several subcommands of csx can be used to advance the development of the component.

# How to customize

## About Manifest

The developer must update the manifest to meet his/her own objectives and communicate his/her intentions to the component.

This section describes how to define and modify Manifest.

### Project Manifest

This section describes the manifest of the component managed by your project.

The version is currently fixed at "v1" only.

example)

```yaml
version: v1
label: sample
components:
- component_path: components/sample_algorithm_indexer.yaml
- component_path: components/sample_algorithm_lens.yaml
- component_path: components/sample_event_indexer.yaml
- component_path: components/sample_relayer.yaml
- component_path: components/sample_snapshot_indexer_evm.yaml
- component_path: components/sample_snapshot_indexer_icp.yaml
- component_path: components/sample_snapshot_indexer_https.yaml
```

### Component Manifest

The description of each component type is different, but the following is a description of the common parts.

`version`: Like the project manifest, currently fixed at âv1â.

`metadata`: These are the places where the meta-information of the Component, which can be any Type, is stored, and are set in the custom attributes of WASM according to the specification of Internet Computer.

Of particular importance is the type, which determines the Component Type, so be sure to check and set it.

- `label`: String / Component name
- `type`: Enum / Component Type (ex: snapshot_indexer_icp)
- `description`: String / Component description field
- `tags`: Array(String) / Tags for component elements

example)

```yaml
version: v1
metadata:
  label: sample_snapshot_indexer_evm
  type: snapshot_indexer_evm
  description: ''
  tags: ...
...
```

The differences between components are presented in the "Components" section below.

#### Note: Working with .env

If you want to use environment variables or secret values in the manifest, you can use the following syntax.

```yaml
version: v1
metadata:
  label: sample_snapshot_indexer_evm
  type: snapshot_indexer_evm
  description: ''
  tags: ...
datasource:
  type: contract
  location:
    id: "${CHAIN_CONTRACT_ID}"
    args:
      network_id: ${CHAIN_NETWORK_ID}
      rpc_url: https://alchemy.com/v2/${CHAIN_ALCHEMY_KEY}
...
```

And then, you can set the environment variables in the `.env` file on the project root.
```
CHAIN_CONTRACT_ID=0x1234567890
CHAIN_NETWORK_ID=1
CHAIN_ALCHEMY_KEY=abcde12345
```

## Components

### About Snapshot Indexer

As mentioned earlier, there are multiple types of Snapshot Indexer, and each datasource has different logic and external connection methods, so there are differences in the way manifest is written.

These Snapshot Indexer types are also specified in `metadata.type`.

- snapshot_indexer_evm
- snapshot_indexer_icp
- snapshot_indexer_https

This section also briefly introduces the manifest items that commonly exist in Snapshot Indexer.

- `datasource` specifies the data source to be collected
  - The method of description varies slightly from component to component. See individual component sections for details.
- `interval` specifies the interval between acquiring and storing data at the destination specified by `datasource`
  - Number / Interval between data acquisition and storage.
  - Set in seconds.

```yaml
datasource: ...
...
interval: 3600
```

### Snapshot Indexer EVM

Select this type if you want to build a data snapshot using HTTPS outcalls from an EVM-compliant blockchain.

In `datasource`, specify the destination network, contract address, and contract function.

- `datasource.location` ... Specify destination network, contract
  - `id`: String / Contract address
  - `args.network_id`: Number / chain_id of the target network
  - `args.rpc_url`: String / rpc endpoint url to connect to the target network
- `datasource.method` ... Specify the function of the contract to be called.
  - `identifier`: String / Interface of the function to be called.
    - Please refer to the interfaces mentioned in the repository below.
      - [rust-ethereum/ethabi: Encode and decode smart contract invocations](https://github.com/rust-ethereum/ethabi)
  - `interface`: Name of the ABI file containing the interface to the above function.
    - Placed under `(project folder)/interfaces`
    - ERC20.json is buildin to the CLI.
  - `args`: String, Number / If the function has arguments, set their values.
    - The value entered is always used in HTTPS outcalls as a fixed value.
      - Snapshot stores function calls with the same conditions as a Snapshot, so it is not possible to calculate the input value each time.

example)

```yaml
version: v1
metadata:
  label: sample_snapshot_indexer_evm
  type: snapshot_indexer_evm
  description: ''
  tags: ...
datasource:
  type: contract
  location:
    id: 6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f
    args:
      network_id: 1
      rpc_url: https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/<YOUR_KEY>
  method:
    identifier: totalSupply():(uint256)
    interface: ERC20.json
    args: []
interval: 3600
cycles: null
```

### Snapshot Indexer ICP

Select this type if you want to use cross canister calls within Internet Computer to build a snapshot of data that can be retrieved from other canisters.

Set the function for the canister to be acquired at `datasource`.

- `datasource.location` ... Specify the canister to retrieve from.
  - `id`: String / Target canister name or id
- `datasource.method` ... Specify the Canister function to call.
  - `method.identifier`: String / interface of the function to be called.
    - Refer to the interface definition in the candid file and enter.
      - NOTE: Exclude "query" in the query call.
  - `method.interface`: Current status "null" fixed.
  - `method.args`: String, Number / If the function has arguments, set their values
    - The value entered is always used in cross contract calls as a fixed value.

`is_target_component` specifies whether the data source is a canister in the Chainsight Platform.

- `is_target_component`: Whether the data source is a Chainsight Component or not
  - If this is not set, the target will act as if it were a Chainsight Component.

example)

```yaml
version: v1
metadata:
  label: sample_snapshot_indexer_icp
  type: snapshot_indexer_icp
  description: ''
  tags: ...
datasource:
  type: canister
  location:
    id: sample_snapshot_indexer_evm
  method:
    identifier: 'get_last_snapshot : () -> (record { value : text; timestamp : nat64 })'
    interface: null
    args: []
is_target_component: null
interval: 3600
```

### Snapshot Indexer HTTPS

Select this type if you want to collect data from a general web, such as a public API server.

The `datasource` specifies the data location to be collected.

- `datasource.url`: String / Specify the URL from which to retrieve data
- `datasource.headers`: Object / Specifies the request header
- `datasource.queries`: Object / Specify request data
  - `type`: "static" or "dynamic"
    - "static" will set it statically in the subsequent `value` field in the manifest
    - "dynamic", where the user writes the logic to calculate parameters in the generated component code
  - `value`: Object / Set the request body in key-value format

example)

```yaml
version: v1
metadata:
  label: Sample Snapshot Indexer Https
  type: snapshot_indexer_https
  description: ''
  tags: ...
datasource:
  url: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price
  headers:
    Content-Type: application/json
  queries:
    type: static
    value:
      ids: dai
      vs_currencies: usd
interval: 3600
cycles: null
```

### Event Indexer

Event Indexer subscribes to Ethereum Contract events and stores them as data in the component.

Specify the contract to be subscribed to and its events in `datasource`. The specification of chains and contracts is the same as in the Snapshot Indexer EVM.

- `datasource.id`: String / Contract address
- `datasource.event`: Specify the target Event
  - `identifier`: event name / identifier
  - `interface`: Name of the ABI file containing the interface to the above event.
- `datasource.network`: Network to which the contract for the specified event belongs
  - `chain_id`: Number / chain_id of the target network
  - `rpc_url`: String / rpc endpoint url to connect to the target
- `datasource.from`: Number / Specifies the block number to start subscribing to
  - Block numbers before the specified number are skipped.
- `datasource.contract_type`: String / Specify the contract type
- `datasource.batch_size`: Optional(Number) / Specify the size of the block to be subscribed at a time.

example)

```yaml
version: v1
metadata:
  label: Event Indexer
  type: event_indexer
  description: ''
  tags: ...
datasource:
  id: 0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F
  event:
    identifier: Transfer
    interface: ERC20.json
  network:
    rpc_url: https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${ALCHEMY_KEY}
    chain_id: 1
  from: 17660942
  contract_type: ERC-20
  batch_size: null
interval: 3600
cycles: null
```

### Algorithm Indexer

The Algorithm Indexer subscribes to data from the Event Indexer and other Algorithm Indexers and allows them to be processed with arbitrary logic.

The `datasource` determines what data source is used as input, and the `output` determines the format of the data produced by the logic.

- `datasource`: Identification of computation source information
  - `datasource.principal`: Component to call
  - `datasource.input`: Type of data to be collected
    - `datasource.input.name`: String / Name of type
    - `datasource.input.fields`: Optional(Object) / Specify the field information of the type, any key name and value type.
      - If it is not set up, code it yourself.
    - `datasource.method`: String / Function name to call
    - `datasource.source_type`: String / Select the data source format
      - `event_indexer` ... Event Indexer Component
      - `key_value`,`key_values` ... Algorithm Indexer Component, More details to follow.
    - The following are similar to Event Indexer
      - `datasource.from`, `datasource.batch_size`
- `output`: Array(Object) / Specify the format of calculation results
  - `output[i].output_type`: Specify the type of storage where the calculation results are to be stored
    - `key_value` ... Store one data in one key.
    - `key_values` ... Store multiple data in one key. That is, it stores an array of data.
  - The following is the same as for `datasource.input`
    - `output[i].name`, `output[i].field`

```yaml
version: v1
metadata:
  label: Algorithm Indexer
  type: algorithm_indexer
  description: ''
  tags: ...
datasource:
  principal: event_indexer_component
  input:
    name: Transfer
    fields:
      from: String
      to: String
      value: chainsight_cdk::core::U256
  from: 17660942
  method: proxy_call
  source_type: event_indexer
  batch_size: null
output:
- name: Account
  fields:
    address: String
  output_type: key_value
- name: AccountBalance
  fields:
    address: String
    balance: u64
  output_type: key_values
interval: 3600
cycles: null
```

### Relayer

Relayer is a component for propagating data computed and maintained by Chainsight Platform to other blockchains.

Therefore, `datasource` and `interval` are the same as Snapshot Indexer ICP, and a new `destination` must be specified to specify the propagation destination.

- `destination.network_id`: Number / chain_id of the target network
- `destination.type`: Enum / Oracle Type
  - To send data to the destination chain, Chainsight provides several Oracle types according to a defined standard, and the developer specifies the type
- `destination.oracle_address`: String / Oracle address
- `destination.rpc_url`: String / rpc endpoint url to call the target network

example)

```yaml
version: v1
metadata:
  label: sample_relayer
  type: relayer
  description: ''
  tags: ...
datasource:
  type: canister
  location:
    id: sample_snapshot_indexer_evm
  method:
    identifier: 'get_last_snapshot_value : () -> (text)'
    interface: null
    args: []
destination:
  network_id: 80001
  type: uint256
  oracle_address: 0539a0EF8e5E60891fFf0958A059E049e43020d9

The above description is only a minimal setup. Further customization is possible.

- To change the caller's contract interface...
  - `destination.method_name`: identifier of the function to call
  - `destination.interface`: ABI of the contract to be called
- `conversion_parameter` allows simple processing of the data to be propagated
  - `extracted_field`: String / Specify the field to propagate
  - `destination_type_to_convert`: String / Specify the type you want to convert
  - `exponent_of_power10`: Number / Use for digit up

example)

```yaml
destination:
  ...
  interface: IProposalSynchronizer.json
  method_name: batchSynchronize
conversion_parameter:
  extracted_field: value.dai.usd
  destination_type_to_convert: U256
  exponent_of_power10: 2
```

**What is Oracle?**

When Relayer propagates data to other blockchains, Chainsight provides Oracle Contract as the target.

It has only a state that stores the specified type in key/value format, where the key is an address constructed from the sender's Canister secret information, allowing the sender to be identified.

There is a specific code below.

[horizonx-tech/chainsight-management-oracle: Oracles supported by Chainsight](https://github.com/horizonx-tech/chainsight-management-oracle)

Check the README in the above repository for the addresses of available oracle contracts that have been deployed.
If you have a network you would like to add, please use that repository or send us an add request.

### Algorithm Lens

Users can define arbitrary logic using Algorithm Lens. All data sources on Chainsight can be used as inputs for the calculations.

`datasource` specifies the source data source for the calculation. You can specify data sources by canister in Chainsight and their endpoints (e.g. functions). Multiple data sources can be specified.

- `datasource.methods`: Array / Specifies the components from which the data originates.
  - `id`: String / Specify the Component to be the data source
    - If in the same project, specify the "component name"
    - Otherwise, specify the canister ID.
      - ex: `thiw2-paaaa-aaaag-qc53a-cai`
  - `identifier`: String / Candid format interface to call to for data source acquisition
  - `candid_file_path`: Optional(String) / Path to the .did file that contains the function interface for the canister that will be the data source
  - `func_name_alias`: Optional(String) / Function name generated in the logic file generated from this data source definition

example)

```yml
version: v1
metadata:
  label: sample_algorithm_lens
  type: algorithm_lens
  description: ''
  tags: ...
datasource:
  methods:
  - id: sample_snapshot_indexer_evm
    identifier: 'get_last_snapshot_value : () -> (record { nat; text })'
    candid_file_path: interfaces/sample_snapshot_indexer_evm.did
  - id: sample_snapshot_indexer_icp
    identifier: 'get_last_snapshot_value : () -> (nat)'
    candid_file_path: interfaces/sample_snapshot_indexer_icp.did
cycles: null
```

## Sources for Component Modules

"csx generate" can be run to generate code for a component module from your project manifest. The codes is generated in the following configuration.

```txt
pj_root/src
|- __interface // ABI and Candid used in the codes
|- accessors // External communication logic
|- bindings // Types for external communication
|- canisters // Core canister codes
|- logics // User-specific customization
|- Cargo.lock
L Cargo.toml
```

Some components can be customized by the user by editing the component-specific `lib.rs` in the `logics` folder.

```txt
logics
|- (component_name)
|  |- src
|  |  L lib.rs
|  L Cargo.toml
...
```

### Case for Snapshot Indexer HTTPS

Snapshot Indexer HTTPS allows filtering on response data that can be retrieved from a specified destination. It can be reflected by updating the field in the rust structure that represents the response data type.

example)

```diff
use candid::{Decode, Encode};
#[derive(Debug, Clone, candid::CandidType, candid::Deserialize, serde::Serialize, chainsight_cdk_macros::StableMemoryStorable)]
pub struct SnapshotValue {
    pub dai: Dai,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, candid::CandidType, candid::Deserialize, serde::Serialize, chainsight_cdk_macros::StableMemoryStorable)]
pub struct Dai {
    pub usd: f64,
-    pub usd_market_cap: f64,
-    pub usd_24h_vol: f64,
-    pub usd_24h_change: f64,
-    pub last_updated_at: f64
}
```

### Case for Algorithm Lens

With respect to Algorithm Lens, it is up to the user to decide how to process data from the specified data source. This logic must be implemented here.

Codes is automatically generated to retrieve data from the specified data source.

example)

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, candid :: CandidType, serde :: Deserialize, serde :: Serialize)]
pub struct LensValue {
    pub dummy: f64,
}
pub async fn calculate(targets: Vec<String>) -> LensValue {
    let _result = get_eth_1(targets.get(0usize).unwrap().clone()).await;
    let _result = get_eth_2(targets.get(1usize).unwrap().clone()).await;
    let _result = get_eth_3(targets.get(2usize).unwrap().clone()).await;

    todo!();
}
```

From the template code as above, update the code as follows, taking into account your own logic. This is an example of calculating an average.

example)

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, Default, candid :: CandidType, serde :: Deserialize, serde :: Serialize)]
pub struct LensValue {
    pub value: f64,
}
pub async fn calculate(targets: Vec<String>) -> LensValue {
    let eth_1 = get_eth_1(targets.get(0usize).unwrap().clone()).await.unwrap();
    let eth_2 = get_eth_2(targets.get(1usize).unwrap().clone()).await.unwrap();
    let eth_3 = get_eth_3(targets.get(2usize).unwrap().clone()).await.unwrap();

    let prices = vec![eth_1, eth_2, eth_3];
    LensValue { value: (prices.iter().sum::<f64>() / prices.len() as f64) }
}
```
